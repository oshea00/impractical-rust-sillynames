# Impractical Rust Projects

I thought it would be fun and useful to practice Rust programming by implementing programs in Rust from the book *Impractical Python Projects* by Lee Vaughn.

This example is for the "Silly Names" project.

## Featuring
* Using random numbers
* Colored terminal output using the 'crossterm' crate.
* Getting user input from std::stdin() in a 'pythonic' way by implmenting input().

## Using
> cargo run
```How many names? 10
